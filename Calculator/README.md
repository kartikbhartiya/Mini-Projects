# 🧮 CLI Calculator in C

This is a simple **command-line calculator** built in C. It evaluates arithmetic expressions provided as string input from the user. The calculator supports the basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` — and can handle expressions written in a single line like `"12+7*3-5"`.

---

## ✨ Features

- Takes full expression input as a string
- Supports:
  - Addition `+`
  - Subtraction `-`
  - Multiplication `*`
  - Division `/`
- Handles negative numbers (like `-10+5`)
- Ignores typos and only parses valid numeric operations
- No use of `eval()` or external libraries — just logic and string parsing

---

## 📥 Sample Input

```c
Enter Everything you want:- 12+7*3-5
```

---

### 📤 Output

```c
12+7*3-5 = 60.00
```
